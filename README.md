# GomokuGame
## Gomoku Game with SFML interface
Here is a school project I made during my second study year

I make a repo as to display algorithms I made 

Feel free to use ;)

I used 
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
as graphic interface, I don't remember how to implements this for the project. It's on your own for implementation.

Right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#:~:text=Players%20alternate%20turns%20placing%20a,not%20result%20in%20a%20win.) you have the rules.
